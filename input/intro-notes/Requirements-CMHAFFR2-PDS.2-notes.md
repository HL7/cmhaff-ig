#### Related Regulations and Standards

While mobile computing environments may introduce some specific threats not present in non-mobilecomputing, the principles of risk management
are the same across environments, so some standards and regulations are cited, even though they are not mobile-centric. Documents (listed
alphabetically below) were sources of some cMHAFF criteria for risk assessment. Other useful references on risk assessment are listed in the
Appendix. While some are realm-specific, they have much material that is applicable beyond their countries. Realms are listed in parentheses, if not explicit in the title.

cMHAFF, and for each risk, there are suggested mitigations.
- **[OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide:](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quickreference-guide/)**- This provides resources for developers that can assist in implementing secure coding practices. It is recommended that developers adopt secure coding practices so that applications are developed with an emphasis on security vs having to apply security measures to protect the application.

#### Implementation Guidance

While later sections in this standard include specific security and privacy controls to be applied to consumer mobile health apps, all products addressing health issues, regardless of their type, must be subjected to an overall risk analysis. This risk analysis may uncover the need for additional security controls over-and-above the conformance statements included in this document. As such, a risk analysis provides an additional layer of considerations such that conformance statements are not misused as a simple checklist in which it is assumed all security risks have been addressed if an app is in compliance with the conformance statements in this standard. For an app/product, the risk analysis should be conducted for the target environment(s) where the app will actually be used by consumers. Because of the diversity of consumers, such a risk analysis is wider ranging and more challenging than a risk analysis for the development organization’s own environment.
